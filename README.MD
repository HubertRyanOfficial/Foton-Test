# List Of Books

In this project you will have a list with your favorites books, you can add new books and listening when you want, without any authentication, everything is stored offline, facilitating the user experience.<br/>**by Hubert Ryan!**

## About ✍

With **Expo**, the entire project has some navigations using **React Navigation**, the routes are: Home, Add Book, Profile & Read Book. All stored made with **Redux** using the Flux structure, helping to persist the data.

In the screen to read the book we use the library called _Expo Speech_ to be able to read the description of the selected book.

## Dependencies 🔧

Below are all the **dependencies** that were used for this project to be completed. These three libraries were enough to make a project like this work.

- [x] Expo
- [x] Expo Speech
- [x] Expo Vector Icons
- [x] Redux
- [x] Redux Persist
- [x] Async Storage
- [x] React Navigation

> Important: Development dependencies are few, especially **Prettier** to help in the organization and standardization of codes.

# Getting Started 🧨

## Install 🔌

First, you need to **clone this project** to an ideal location on your computer. You can clone either using the github command line or by downloading directly from the browser or the WINRAR file, after that, extract it.

Remembering that in this project we use **Expo**, so to start this project you must have installed _Expo CLI_ to be able to work.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/HubertRyanOfficial/Foton-Test.git
```

or

```sh
Download direct to you computer with WINRAR or with GitHub Desktop.
```

Second, install **all necessary project dependencies** locally so that the project can run smoothly. Of course, go to the project folder before that!

```sh
$ yarn install
```

or

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Run the project 🖥

As I said above, you need _Expo CLI_ !

> Important: Without this configuration the application will not work!

Now just run.

```sh
$ yarn start
```

or

```sh
$ npm start
```

Now we can use and develop our project, are we going to test together with me? **Let's Go!**

# Thank You 🎉
